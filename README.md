Ported from the **Official Fancy Beds 3.4 Java Edition Texture Pack** by _tranQuila_ simply helps Minecraft players to replace each bed in-game with a completely new and unique bed design. If you are bored with the original default texture of the bed, this pack is highly recommended for you. With this pack installed, the beds will get a new look which is more outstanding and compelling. From that, the beds can be fitted into more decorations, giving more life to Minecraft!
